# Level 1

## Data
Each user has a name, an objective and an id (which will be used to reference the user in a deal).
Each deal has an amount and a user who closed the deal.

## Goal

We're trying to calculate the compensations of 2 users, knowing what deals they sold during the month.

## Commissioning

Your objective is to calculate the compensation of each user, knowing that they are commissioned as such:
- 10% of what they sell if they sold 1 or 2 deals during the month
- 20% of what they sold if they sold 3 deals or more
- 500 euros bonus if they sold more than 2000 euros in the month

# Technology used

To stock the data, I choose to use a database which i can create directly from python. It is called SQLite and it's very practical and easy to use for a small quantity of data.

# Difficulties

I didn't have much trouble with the Level 1.
